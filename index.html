<p>Everyone knows the history of the Civil War.  The South seceded from the union but,
defeated, was forced to rejoin.  But what if things had gone differently?</p>

<p>Welcome to the world of <strong>The Labor Wars</strong>.  The year is 1923.  The continent
is divided into seven nations.  And in the Lone Star Republic, labor and
management have been fighting a ground war for over a decade.</p>

<p>Respected politician Timothy Althaus has called a series of emergency meetings
at his home.  Althaus has invited the most important labor leaders, politicians,
business owners, and mercenaries in a last-ditch attempt to end this war.  But
recent mysterious deaths, changes in leadership, and rumors of outside threats
cast a pall over the negotiations.</p>

<p><em>Can the parties reach an amicable compromise?  Or will this labor conflict
destroy the Lone Star Republic?</em></p>
