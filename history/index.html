<h2>The Confederate Revolution</h2>

<p>The <strong>Confederate States of America</strong> seceded from the United States in January
1861, sparking a bloody war.  Throughout the first half of that year, more
states, including Virginia and Arkansas, seceded and joined the CSA as well.</p>

<p>Then, fagtigued from three years of fighting, the <strong>Northwest Confederacy</strong> seceded
from the USA in June 1864.  This, combined with English and French recognition
for the CSA, proved to be the deciding factor.  Unable to fight a two-front war,
the USA admitted defeat in September.</p>

<h2>The Western American War</h2>

<p>The peace was to last for less than two years.  In February 1866, the
<strong>Lone Star Republic</strong> declared its independence from the CSA.  This declaration
began a second war, lasting until May of 1867.</p>

<p>The Northwest Confederacy was slow to respond at first, but in April of 1866
finally launched an offensive, egged on with guns and training by the CSA.
Unfortunately for the Confederacy, they failed to count on the involvement of
the many indigenous people living in the Lone Star Republic.  It was primarily
due to these fighters that the LSR was able to successfully wage a war of
attrition, ending with massive casualties for the Northwest.  The
self-governing <strong>Lone Star Indian Territories</strong> was established shortly
thereafter in the former Oklahoma territory.</p>

<h2>The Farite Revolution</h2>

<p>Late in 1872, political essayist Michael Farrad was hanged for treason in the
Northwest Confederacy after sharply criticizing the government for its failure
to protect human rights in the states.  The crowd at the hanging grew rowdy and
proceeded to erupt into a full-scale riot, followed by a battle.  This was
followed by similar uprisings by angry citizens throughout the following year.</p>

<p>It was the work of Simon Sterne in August that catalyzed these uprisings into
an actual organized revolt.  Sterne traveled the country stirring up support.
His group secretly set up its home base in the town of Kuna, Idaho.  When the
government found out, their troops pillaged and burned the town.</p>

<p>This proved to be their fatal mistake.  This brutality galvanized Sterne's
supporters and gained him popular sympathy.  By February of 1874, the <strong>Free
American Republic</strong> had declared victory.</p>

<h2>Alyeuska</h2>

<p>When gold was discovered in the Klondike in 1896, Canada's long-standing hopes
to purchase the Alaska territory from Russia were effectively quashed.
As discontented Farites and prospectors from all origins flooded north, the
territory became one of the most populous Russian holdings.</p>

<p>As Russia's involvement in World War I dragged on, Alaskan citizens became
increasingly discontent.  In August 1917, the <strong>Russian Revolution</strong> began in
Anchorage.  This new home front forced Russia out of the war by November.
Shortly thereafter, the <strong>People's Republic of Alyeuska</strong> announced its
sovereignty.</p>

<h2>The Labor Wars</h2>

<p>Meanwhile, on May 6, 1909, in Waco, Texas, a group of farm workers employed by
Amalgamated Farms went on strike.  When the bosses brought in scabs the
following day, fighting broke out in the fields.  Unions quickly formed and
battle lines started to be drawn.  What began as skirmishes here and there
gradually increased over the years into a full-scale war between dozens of
parties.</p>

<p>With the entry of the Freemen, the trade associations, the International Workers
of the World, and finally the Working Women, the stage was set for 1918 to be
the bloodiest year yet in the Labor Wars, with 3,000 killed in battle.</p>

<p>1920 saw the formation of the Labor Party, an organized political force for
labor interests in Congress.  Their presidential candidate John Gomez was
defeated in the 1921 election by the opposition Free Soil Party's candidate
Andrew Smith.  Smith had run on a platform of non-involvement in the Labor Wars.
However, under pressure from
business interest groups and their supporters in Congress, he signed the
narrowly-passed Labor Regulation Act the following year.  For this, his own vice
president, Timothy Sparrow, challenged Smith to a duel and killed him.</p>

<p>By April 1923, the Labor Wars had been raging unabated for 14 years, with
thousands of lives lost on both sides.  Fearing the consequences if no
action was taken, prominent politician Timothy Althaus organized a series of
peace talks at his mansion.  Could a last-ditch attempt at reconciliation save
the Republic?</p>
