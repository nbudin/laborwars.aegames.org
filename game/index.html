      <h1>Format</h1>

<p>The Labor Wars takes place over a full weekend, starting on Friday night and
continuing through Saturday into Sunday afternoon.  An in-character dinner
will be served on Saturday night.</p>

<p>Each day of the game represents one of the three meetings at Timothy Althaus's
house.  <em>They are not consecutive days in game time.</em>  At the end of each night,
players will engage in a wargame, simulating their group's actions between that
meeting and the following one.</p>

<p><em>It is possible for characters to die during the war game, or from duels.</em>
Should this happen, the character will be replaced by another person from their
faction, played by the same player.</p>

<h1>Mechanics</h1>

<p>The Labor Wars is a politics-heavy, roleplay-oriented, mechanics-light,
theatre-style LARP.  Dueling will be simulated using a simple
mini-game.</p>
